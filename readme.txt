2. Click Activate
3. Follow the instructions in the step by step set up wizard. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Why should I install Rollerblade on my clients' sites or sites that my Wordpress team is working on?** 
Because it's going to save you tons of time over the traditional QA and web site feedback methods. Once you try it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Here's the video answer to this question:

== Screenshots ==
1. Activate the Rollerblade tool by clicking the icon. The icon appears only for the user roles you authorize in the plugin settings. (You can also show it for visitors that are not logged in, if you'd like).
2. After activating the tool (one click) the client then gets a tool tip instructing them to click and drag anywhere on the site. Even your clients that have trouble using Facebook will be able to use this tool.
3. The comment box pops up automatically and the client just starts typing. They click submit and their job is done. Seriously...anyone can use this tool on the front end.
4. After submission, a ticket is created and you get an email notification with all of the details and the screenshot attached to it.
5. The ticket interface shows you the ticket number, URL, reporter, date and status. (We're currently prioritizing feature requests for the tickets interface so let us know what you want next). 
6. Tickets provide the screenshotted area plus the surrounding area so you can always see the clients' selected part of the page IN CONTEXT, reducing confusion. 
7. You can select who gets notified of new tickets and ticket updates in your Rollerblade account settings. 
8. The Rollerblade settings on your Wordpress site are where you link your Rollerblade account and decide which user roles will see the Rollerblade feedback tool.
